A nice little C# console program I made to simulate trying to roll a charge in the miniature wargame Age of Sigmar.


The program is pretty simple but solid, containing all necessary safety nets.


I sometimes use this to roll my charges instead of rolling dice, because it could be more fun that way sometimes.


How to run:

Go to Releases, the only tag that's there.

Go to 0.7.

Follow the instructions on that page.
